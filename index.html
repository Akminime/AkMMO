        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Aiden and I am a highschool student intrested in coding and games. This is going to be a project I do in my spare time based on the popular MMO, World Of Warcraft. A lot of inspiration will be coming from that game but I hope that you all enjoy my take on a true, open world survival game. My plan for the game is for at launch have 4 classes, worrior, a melee focused class using swords and axes, mage, master of the arcane arts and able to call upon the elements of our world, hunter, stealth masters using bows and thrown weapons, and the bard, a musical character that works on helping there team rather than attacking. If you have any comments or would like to help me in the development of my game, join my discord, </p>
